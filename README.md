**Abstract**  
In our IoT-based research projects, we have developed and implemented the Cybersecurity-Aware Access Control \& Mitigation Actions Platform (CAAC\&MAP) to generate access control decisions and mitigation actions by utilising the weaknesses and attack patterns detected in the requested IoT devices. The platform helps enterprise-level ICT administrators manage IoT devices within the organisation without worrying about the correct remediation actions to reduce the risk of using vulnerable IoT devices. We compared our results utilising implementations over similar policy models to confirm the performance metrics are trustable enough for use in production environments.
